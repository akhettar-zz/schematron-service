Version: 1.0

About:

The NLM validation service is a REST service that accept NLM XML - Or a zip file containing NLM XMLs and applies DTD validation against NLM DTD.It also validates the NLM XML against schematron rules.

This service is entrely independent of the NLM DTD and the schematron rules which are stored in the file server. Thereofre, any changes made to these files will get reflected on the REST service without deploying or even restarting the application server.

The NLM Validaiotn project compirses of two modules, namely nlm-validation-core and nlm-validation-service. The former hosts the DTD and the schematron validation business logic and the latter is a thin REST servcie, which makes use of the nlm-validation-servie to carry out the validation process.

Hudson

We have two continous builds  running for this project on hudson:

1- Validation-pipeline: It packages the NLM DTD, schematron rules and some other files into a zip file and deploy it to the file server.
2- nlm-validation: Run continous build and JUnit test suites.
